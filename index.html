        <h1>Building a Standalone Rust Binary<br>for a Scratch Docker Container</h1>
        <h4>Brenden Hyde<br>1-10-2020</h4>

        <h2>TL;DR:</h2>
        <p>I wanted to make a standalone Rust binary that would run on a barebones Docker container (basically a <a href="https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/105/chroot-jail-what-is-it-and-how-do-i-use-it">chroot jail</a>) that contained only that single file. I discovered it was not that straightforward.
        </p>

        <h2>Background</h2>
        <p>According to my shallow understanding of Rust, one of its promises is that it compiles code into a single binary file that does not require a runtime environment or VM, unlike interpreted languages that compile down to bytecode such as Python and Java.
        Rust achieves this through a process called static linking, wherein the included Rust libraries and dependencies are all built into the compiled binary.
        In contrast, dynamic linking is a process in which a compiled binary points to shared system libraries that live on the operating system's filesystem, separate from the binary itself.
        </p>
        <p>Rust offers static linking as one of its benefits.
        However, it is unfortunately not that simple.
        According to Rust's documentation,</p>
        <blockquote>"Pure-Rust dependencies are statically linked by default so you can use created binaries and libraries without installing Rust everywhere. By contrast, native libraries (e.g. libc and libm) are usually dynamically linked..."<sub><a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/1.13.0/book/advanced-linking.html#static-linking">[1]</a></sub>.
        </blockquote>
        <p>In other words, only Rust dependencies get statically linked by default; all of the non-Rust libraries like C libraries are dynamically linked.
        In most scenarios, this dynamic linking is not a problem.
        Afer all, the system that you copy your compiled executable to will likely have the required libraries.
        This is not the case for a barebones docker container, as we will see.
        </p>

        <h2>Barebones Docker Containers</h2>
        <p>Docker containers come in a variety of flavors, most of which are based on lightweight Linux distros.
        There are containers for Ubuntu, Debian, and Alpine Linux, to name a few.
        Despite these containers being tiny operating systems unto themselves, most introductory readings about containers will tell you that treating a container like a virtual machine is an anti-pattern.
        VMs are meant to be fairly long-lived, emulate hardware, and they come with their own kernels.
        Contrast that with containers, which are meant to be ephemeral, emulate the operating system rather than hardware, and rely on the container server's kernel.
        Therefore, I was determined to make Docker "put its money where its mouth is" by spinning up a container that was a glorified chroot evironment whose only outside dependency was the kernel.
        </p>

        <h2>Initial Setup</h2>
        <h3>Rust Hello World</h3>
        <p>Using Rust's cargo command, one can make a hello world binary with just a few commands:
        <code>
            <span class="prompt">brenden$:&gt; cargo new hello</span>
            <span class="prompt">brenden$:&gt; cd hello</span>
            <span class="prompt">brenden$:&gt; cargo build --release</span>
        </code>
        </p>
        <p>The resultant binary will work on another computer of the same type as the one where it was compiled.
        If I compile it on macOS X Mojave, I can give just the opaque binary to someone else running Mojave and be pretty sure it will run.
        Because of this assurance, I had never really dug any deeper.
        </p>

        <h3>Dockerfile</h3>
        <p>I used a multi-stage <span><code>Dockerfile</code></span> to define two containers-- one for building the binary and one for running it.
        It looked like this:
        <code>
            <span class="comment"># Create the build container to compile the hello world program</span>
            FROM rust:1.40-stretch as builder
            ENV USER root
            RUN cargo new hello
            WORKDIR hello
            RUN cargo build --release

            <span class="comment"># Create the execution container by copying the compiled hello world to it and running it</span>
            FROM scratch
            COPY --from=builder /hello/target/release/hello /hello
            CMD ["/hello"]
        </code>
        </p>

        <p>From everything I had read (which honestly wasn't much, as I am just starting to use Docker), this looked passable.
        The build step seemed to work fine, as shown below:

        <code>
            <span class="prompt">brenden$:&gt; docker build -t test/rust-hello:latest .</span>
            Sending build context to Docker daemon  307.2kB
            Step 1/8 : FROM rust:1.40-stretch as builder
            ---> df5aae0d2dbf
            Step 2/8 : ENV USER root
            ---> Using cache
            ---> afe8a4cfdde3
            Step 3/8 : RUN cargo new hello
            ---> Using cache
            ---> 9a4826f41fca
            Step 4/8 : WORKDIR hello
            ---> Using cache
            ---> 2980899a43c9
            Step 5/8 : RUN cargo build --release
            ---> Using cache
            ---> 45520d0f5219
            Step 6/8 : FROM scratch
            --->
            Step 7/8 : COPY --from=builder /hello/target/release/hello /hello
            ---> Using cache
            ---> 70634303a372
            Step 8/8 : CMD ["/hello"]
            ---> Using cache
            ---> b3d523bdd185
            Successfully built b3d523bdd185
            Successfully tagged test/rust-hello:latest
        </code>
        </p>

        <p>
        But, the run resulted in an error:
        <code>
            <span class="prompt">brenden$:&gt; docker run test/rust-hello:latest</span>
            standard_init_linux.go:207: exec user process caused "no such file or directory"
        </code>
        </p>

        <p>At first I thought this was an incompatibility issue between macOS X and linux, so I tried it on my <a href="https://system76.com">System76</a> laptop running Debian 9-- the result was the same failure.
        </p>

        <h2>Postmortem</h2>
        <p>
        After some research, I found out that Rust statically links pure Rust dependencies, but it dynamically links C libraries.
        One can see from the output of the <span><code>ldd</code></span> command (Linux) or the <span><code>otool</code></span> command (OS X) which libraries have been dynamically linked:

        <code>
            <span class="comment"># on macOSX Mojave</span>

            <span class="prompt">brenden$:&gt; otool -L hello/target/release/hello</span>
            hello/target/release/hello:
            /usr/lib/libSystem.B.dylib (compatibility version 1.0.0, current version 1252.250.1)
            /usr/lib/libresolv.9.dylib (compatibility version 1.0.0, current version 1.0.0)

            <span class="comment"># on Debian 9 (Linux)</span>

            <span class="prompt">brenden$:&gt; ldd hello/target/release/hello</span>
            linux-vdso.so.1 (0x00007ffcab9e3000)
            libdl.so.2 => /lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libdl.so.2 (0x00007fe82550b000)
            librt.so.1 => /lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/librt.so.1 (0x00007fe825501000)
            libpthread.so.0 => /lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libpthread.so.0 (0x00007fe8254e0000)
            libgcc_s.so.1 => /lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libgcc_s.so.1 (0x00007fe8254c6000)
            libc.so.6 => /lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libc.so.6 (0x00007fe825305000)
            /lib64/ld-linux-x86-64.so.2 (0x00007fe825568000)

        </code>
        </p>

        <h2>Statically Link Everything</h2>
        <p>Obviously this was no good. I wanted to statically link every single dependency so I could have a truly standalone binary.
        Some searching yielded two excellent results.
        On Rust's official documentation, I found an <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/1.13.0/book/advanced-linking.html#linux">explanation</a> of an alternative to <span><code>libc</code></span>called <span><code>musl</code></span>.
        </p>
        <blockquote>"Dynamic linking on Linux can be undesirable if you wish to use new library features on old systems or target systems which do not have the required dependencies for your program to run. Static linking is supported via an alternative libc, musl."<a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/1.13.0/book/advanced-linking.html#linux"><sub>[2]</sub></a>
        </blockquote>
        <p>So, <span><code>musl</code></span> is an alternative implementation of <span><code>libc</code></span> that developers use to package directly (read: statically link) with Rust binaries so that they are batteries-included.
        </p>
        <p><a href="https://github.com/emk/rust-musl-builder">On GitHub</a> I found a repo called <span><code>rust-musl-builder</code></span> that is described as a "Docker container for easily building static Rust binaries".
        </p>
        <p>
        Armed with a new technique, I made a second attempt that did away with the build container, choosing instead to build directly on my System76 laptop assisted by the rust-musl-builder container. The code to build it looked like this:
        <code>
            <span class="prompt">brenden$:&gt; alias rust-musl-builder='sudo docker run --rm -it -v "$(pwd)":/home/rust/src ekidd/rust-musl-builder'</span>

            <span class="prompt">brenden$:&gt; rust-musl-builder cargo build --release</span>

            <span class="comment"># the output was sent to a different dir this time</span>
            <span class="comment"># check it with ldd to show any dynamically linked libs</span>
            <span class="prompt">brenden$:&gt; ldd  hello/target/x86_64-unknown-linux-musl/release/hello</span>
            not a dynamic executable
        </code>
        </p>

        <p>Then it was time to write a simplified <span><code>Dockerfile</code></span> that just copied the build artifact to a scratch container and ran it:
        <code>
            FROM scratch
            COPY hello/target/x86_64-unknown-linux-musl/release/hello /hello
            CMD ["/hello"]
        </code>
        </p>

        <p>Build the container image:
        <code>
            <span class="prompt">brenden$:&gt; sudo docker build -t test/rust-hello</span>
        </code>
        </p>

        <p>Finally, it was time for a test run:
        <code>
            <span class="prompt">brenden$:&gt; sudo docker run test/rust-hello</span>
            Hello, world!
        </code>
        </p>

        <p>Success!</p>

        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p>For anyone more experienced with docker containers, this may seem obvious. For me, a person who backed into a DevOps career by way of sysadmin-ing, this was an unexpected challenge. I had always taken it on faith that Rust made binaries that were fully self-contained, but ultimately I found this to be only a partial truth. This was a fun learning experience, and I was proud to have figured it out.
